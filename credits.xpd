		<h1 class="PageTitle">Credits</h1>
		
		<p>So many acknowledgements are due!</p>
		
		<h4>Intellectual Acknowledgements</h4>

<p>Other sites that have inspired various things you see here. GovTrack was initially inspired by <a 
href="http://votesmart.org/index.htm">Project Vote Smart</a>, <a 
href="http://www.opensecrets.org">OpenSecrets</a> and the commercial <a 
href="http://capitoladvantage.com/capwiz/">CapWiz</a>.</p>

<p>Ideas for several
components of the site have been derived from elsewhere: <a 
href="http://www.richmondsunlight.com/">RichmondSunlight</a> for how the status of
legislation is displayed on bill pages, and <a 
href="http://www.washingtonwatch.com/">WashingtonWatch</a> for showing
costs-per-taxpayer of legislation, and <a href="http://www.opencongress.org">OpenCongress</a>
for the crowd-sourcing of related legislation. The Leader-Follower scores are based on an idea by Joseph Barillari (one of my college classmates).
I'm sure I have drawn ideas from many other places as well.</p>

<p>(Interestingly, some credit was due to the government's
Orwellian but fortunately dead-before-it-started Total Information Awareness project,
which inspired the short-lived MIT media lab project Government Information Awareness,
which in turn provided the initial database of legislators used here.)</p>

<h4>Financial Acknowledgements</h4>

<p>Though the site is primarily self-funded through the advertising (<a href="ads.xpd">more
on the advertising</a>), and through the contributions in time of those who have
worked on the site, a small part of the development of the site has been externally funded.</p>

<p>The interactivity on the bill text pages was developed by Kevin Henry supported by
a grant from the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>.
Thanks, Sunlight!</p>
