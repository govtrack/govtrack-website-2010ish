	<p>Launched in 2004 as a hobby of <a href="http://razor.occams.info">Joshua Tauberer</a>, 
	GovTrack.us was the first website worldwide whose primary goal was to provide free comprehensive 
	legislative tracking for everyday citizens and to embrace Web 2.0 and open data for government 
	information. GovTrack.us was a 2006 <a 
	href="http://webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=10#webby_entry_politics">Webby Award 
	nominee</a> and has been covered in <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/articles/20050126nyt.xpd">The 
	New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/articles/20060301wp.xpd">The Washington 
	Post</a>.</p>
	
	<p>You'll find here the <a href="/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6331">status of U.S. federal 
	legislation</a>, <a href="/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2008-469">voting records</a> for the Senate 
	and House of Representatives, information on <a href="/congress/person.xpd?id=400365">Members of 
	Congress</a>, <a href="/congress/findyourreps.xpd">district maps</a>, as well as congressional 
	committees and the Congressional Record.</p>
	
	<h4>How it works</h4>
	
	<p>The information shown on this site is assembled in an automated way
	from official government websites (primarily from the website <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">THOMAS</a>,
	the official website for the status of legislation run by the Library of Congress).
	The process of gathering the information is entirely automatic and Congress
	isn't always very happy to share, so you may find occasional errors here, but we
	take errors very seriously and work hard to correct them.</p>
	
	<p>The status and text of legislation is usually delayed by about 24 hours 
	and roll call votes usually appear on the site within an hour because we can only
	get information as fast as the official sites put it online.</p>
	
	<p>Our database also extends into the past. You can search and browse bills going back to the
	103rd Congress (1993-94), though the text of legislation goes back only as far as the 106th
	Congress (1999-2000). Roll call votes are available back to the start of our nation!.</p>

		<p>Starting in July 2008, several others have contributed to the development of this site.
		<a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/publius/">Daniel Gabriele</a> did design work.
		Kevin Henry developed the interactivity on the new bill text display (supported by a <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> grant).
		Thanks to Mike Drescher for collecting some images of Members of Congress. Ben Rellick designed
		some updated logos.</p>
