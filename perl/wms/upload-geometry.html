		<h1>WMS API: upload-geometry</h1>
		
		<p>The <tt>upload-geometry.cgi</tt> API access method is used to 
		create geographic features, using longitude-latitude 
		coordinates, in what is called a "dataset". Datasets lack any 
		visual styling information, which is instead set in "layers". 
		This form facilitates manual calling of this API method, 
		although the API can be called automatedly through an HTTP POST 
		interface.</p>
		
		<p>Fill out the form below:</p>
		
		<form action="upload-geometry.cgi" method="post">
			<p>API Key: <input name="key" value="test"/> (Your password to access the dataset named next.)</p>
			<p>Dataset: <input name="dataset" value="test"/> (The name of the dataset to modify.</p>
			<p>Geometry table:</p>
			<p><textarea name="geometry" cols="100" rows="12">region1 points:-70,40,-80,40,-75,50
region2 points:-75,45
</textarea></p>
			<p><input type="submit" value="Upload"/></p>
		</form>
		
		<p>When you click submit, the dataset you specified will be 
		updated. Any layers that use these geographic features will 
		change. If the test layer uses these features, as it should (but 
		people playing with these forms can change it at will), you can 
		see the results <a href="example_testlayer.html">here</a>. You 
		may need to reload the page to see changes.</p>
