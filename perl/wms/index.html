<h1>WMS Server Documentation</h1>

<p>This is the starting page for Josh's experimental WMS
server project.</p>

<p>This WMS server project is a generic backend for serving
geospacial image data, intended for the use case of generating
cartographic visualizations like color-coded charts, rather than
navigational maps.</p>

<p>More information...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maps served by this server can be viewed with any
	WMS-compatible map viewer. Example uses you can see here are:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="example_openlayers.html">OpenLayers example</a></li>
	<li><a href="example_googlemaps.html">Google Maps API example</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Several layers exist on this server that you can try viewing
	by modifying the examples above. These layers color the regions
	arbitrarily, but attempting to prevent adjacent regions from
	having the same color.
	<table>
	<tr><th>Layer Name</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>states</td> <td>U.S. states</td></tr>
	<tr><td>cd-110</td> <td>U.S. congressional districts 2007-2008</td></tr>
	<tr><td>counties</td> <td>U.S. counties</td></tr>
	<tr><td>countysubs</td> <td>U.S. towns (generally incorporated)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>cdps</td> <td>U.S. towns (generally unincorporated, "Census Data Places")</td></tr>
	<tr><td>sldl</td> <td>U.S. state legislative districts, lower chamber (current in Jan 2008)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>sldu</td> <td>U.S. state legislative districts, upper chamber (current in Jan 2008)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>zipcodes</td> <td>U.S. census ZCTAs (approximations of zipcodes)</td></tr>
	</table>
	</li>
	
	<li>Remember that layers (style info) and geometry are kept separate in this
	system. You can make your own layers based on the existing geometry
	datasets that have already been uploaded. The geometry datasets that 
	are already available are:
	
	<table>
	<tr><th>Dataset Identifier</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/states</td> <td>U.S. states</td></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/congress/house/110</td> <td>U.S. congressional districts 2007-2008</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/counties</td> <td>U.S. counties</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/countysubs</td> <td>U.S. towns (generally incorporated)</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/cdps</td> <td>U.S. towns (generally unincorporated, "Census Data Places")</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/sld/lower</td> <td>U.S. state legislative districts, lower chamber (current in Jan 2008)</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/sld/upper</td> <td>U.S. state legislative districts, upper chamber (current in Jan 2008)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/us/zctas</td> <td>U.S. census ZCTAs (approximations of zipcodes)</td></tr> 
	</table>
	The fact that the dataset identifiers are URLs is entirely incidental (though not without reason).
	</li>
	
	<li>You can color the datasets above according to your own needs using the
	<tt>upload-styles.cgi</tt> API method.  See the section "Uploading a Layer"
	in the <a href="apidocs.html">API documentation</a>. You can use your own
	uploader or <a href="upload-styles.html">this form</a> to upload style data.
	You'll need to provide the identifiers of regions that make up the dataset
	you choose. See the "Listing Regions in a Dataset or Layer" section of the
	API documentation for how to do that (<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/perl/wms/list-regions.cgi?dataset=http://www.rdfabout.com/rdf/usgov/congress/house/110">example
	for U.S. congressional districts</a>).</li>

	<li>It is also possible to upload your own geometry, in order for you
	to create layers for different regions than already exist on the 
	server. To do this, use the
	<tt>upload-geometry.cgi</tt> API method.  See the section "Uploading a Dataset"
	in the <a href="apidocs.html">API documentation</a>. You can use your own
	uploader or <a href="upload-geometry.html">this form</a> to upload geometry data.</li>
	
	<li>In order to create a new layer or dataset, you will need an API
	key, which is just used to make sure you don't modify other people's
	data. Please contact <a href="http://razor.occams.info">me</a> to
	get one. The "test" API key can be used to modify the layer named "test"
	and the dataset named "test", and you can view the results on the
	<a href="example_testlayer.html">test layer example page</a>. Feel free to play.<li>

	<li>The source code for this project is maintained in
	a Subversion repository at URL <tt>svn://occams.info/viz/wms</tt>
	and can be <a href="http://razor.occams.info/code/repo/?/viz/wms/">browsed</a>.</li>
