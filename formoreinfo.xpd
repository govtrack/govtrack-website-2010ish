		<p style="font-weight: bold">Other Aspects of Federal Law</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The United States Code (Statutes): Statutory law is the component of U.S. law that is enacted by
		the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Code is the compilation of statutory law,
		pieced together from the text of the bills enacted by Congress.
		The text of the U.S. Code can be read at the
		<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/">Cornell Legal Information 
		Institute</a> website. More information can be found at the
		<a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/federal/uscode.html">Library of Congress</a>.  (You can also get the Code from the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html">GPO</a>
		and <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/">The House</a>.)
		And of course you can track the statutory-law-making process right
		here on GovTrack.</li>
		<li>The Code of Federal Regulations and the Register:
		The U.S. Congress has delegated authority to executive-branch
		agencies to create regulations, and this is the component of
		law created by and controlled by the executive branch of government.
		Regulations are considered a part of the U.S. law. Rule-making is the
		process of creating regulations, and public-comment periods are often
		required. This process is published in the Federal Register, which
		you can access at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/">Regulations.gov</a>
		or the independent sites <a href="http://regulationroom.org/">Regulation Room</a>, <a href="http://openregulations.org">OpenRegulations.org</a>,
		<a href="http://www.govpulse.us">GovPulse.us</a>, and <a href="http://fedthread.org">FedThread.org</a>.
		The compilation of regulations is called the Code of Federal Regulations,
		which you can read online at <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov">GPOAccess</a>. GPO maintains an exclusive ability to publish the CFR, much to the chagrin of open government advocates.</li>
		<li>Common Law / Case Law: Common law is the aspect of law that results from judicial
		decisions. The United States at the time of the revolution
		generally inherited the common law of England. Today, the common
		law is the result of rulings of the judicial branch of the government.
		Case law in the United States, the decisions that determine common law,
		has been in the past notoriously privileged to lawyers and those who can pay for
		access to its only publications by private companies.
		You can find court opinions at 
		<a href="http://www.justia.com/">Justia</a>,
		<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/co.html">Cornell's Legal Information Institute</a>,
		<a href="http://www.findlaw.com/">FindLaw</a>, or
		<a href="http://www.altlaw.org">AltLaw.org</a>.</li>
		<li>The U.S. Constitution: The <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html">U.S. Constitution</a> outlines the structure of government, supersedes
		any other aspect of law, and is the hardest aspect of law to change.
		It and the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html">Bill of Rights</a>, the first ten amendments to the constitution,
		are the only founding documents that are a part of law.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p style="font-weight: bold">State Law and Legislation</p>
		
		<p>The first thing to try to find state law and legislation is to
		look for your state's official websites with a web search (such as
		"New York legislature"). More information can be found at <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/lis/lrl/50statetracking.htm">NCSL 50-State Legislative Tracking Web Resources</a>
		and <a href="http://www.whpgs.org/f.htm">Full-text state statutes and legislation on the Internet</a>.
		Here are some independent websites that address legislative tracking
		at the state level, by state:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Massachusetts: <a href="http://www.openmass.org">OpenMass.org</a></li>
			<li>Illinois: <a href="http://www.illinoistrack.us/">IllinoisTrack.us</a></li>
			<li>Virginia: <a href="http://richmondsunlight.org/">Richmond Sunlight</a></li>
			<li>Washington: <a href="http://beta.knowledgeaspower.org/">Knowledge as Power</a></li>
